	"The self-destructive way to do it is to convince yourself that 'there's just one more to go...' and pull out at about a 1:30. If, and only if, you can convince your body that it's only got one stroke left, you can really empty the tank (and, immediately afterwards, your stomach).",
	"Rowers do more before 8:00am than most people do all day.",
	"Real athletes row. Everyone else just plays games." ,
	"Crew is life ... everything else is just details.",
	"I have come to the conclusion that rowing alone won't bring top of the line erg scores. The two are really completely different. The motion is, of course, fairly similar to rowing. However moving your own body back and foth on a machine that doesn't move is a challenge that cannot be mastered unless it is trained. Therefore, I believe that people who only row will find it harder to pull scores on the erg that are in the highest percentile."
